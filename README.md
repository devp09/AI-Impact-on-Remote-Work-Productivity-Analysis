# AI Impact on Remote Work Productivity Analysis (2025)

## Overview
This repository contains a data analysis project conducted by [Your Name], a Data Analyst, to explore the impact of AI on remote work productivity in 2025. The analysis leverages SQL for data querying, Python for visualization, and Power BI/Tableau for interactive dashboards. The project aims to showcase data analytics skills and support job opportunities as of 04:38 PM EDT, August 16, 2025.

## Dataset
- **File**: `remote_work_ai_2025.csv`
- **Description**: Sample data tracking productivity increase, meeting time reduction, and tech fatigue across months in 2025. Data is estimated based on 2023â€“2024 trends (e.g., Gartner, Statista).
- **Columns**:
  - `Month`: Month-Year (e.g., Jan-25)
  - `Productivity_Increase_Pct`: Percentage increase in productivity
  - `Meeting_Time_Reduction_Pct`: Percentage reduction in meeting time
  - `Tech_Fatigue_Pct`: Percentage of employees reporting tech fatigue

## Analysis
- **SQL Script**: `analysis.sql`
  - Queries calculate averages (e.g., 33.75% average productivity increase) and month-over-month trends.
  - Run in SQLite or any SQL environment.
- **Python Script**: `visualization.py`
  - Generates a line chart (`ai_remote_work_chart.png`) using matplotlib, showing productivity, meeting reduction, and tech fatigue trends with trend lines.
  - Requires pandas and matplotlib libraries.

## Visualization
- **File**: `ai_remote_work_chart.png`
- **Description**: A line chart visualizing the impact of AI on remote work productivity from January to August 2025. Green line for productivity increase (peaking at 35%), orange for meeting time reduction (20%), and red for tech fatigue (15%).
- **Interactive Version**: Published in Power BI or Tableau Public. Check the LinkedIn post for the live link.
